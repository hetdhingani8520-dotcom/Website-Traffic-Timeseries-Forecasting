# Website-Traffic-Timeseries-Forecasting
In this proejct, I have used the website traffic dataset which is named as (lacity.org-website-traffic.csv) and metadata (socrata_metadata.json), which is available in kaggle, here is the link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cityofLA/lacity.org-website-traffic). I have performed Data preprocessing, EDA, and trained the models like ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM for timeseries forecasting analysis and compared each model and also created a visualization.
